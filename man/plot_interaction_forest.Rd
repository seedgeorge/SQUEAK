\title{Plot Interaction Terms from the ME Model}
\usage{
plot_interaction_forest(model, palette = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The mixed-effect model produced by the mixed_effect_model function}

\item{palette}{A custom palette for the graph, from the set_palette() function (optional)}
}
\value{
A graph in ggplot format, a forest plot of interaction terms, ie. slope coefficients.
}
\description{
This SQUEAK function uses a pre-computed model and plots the interaction term results for each group.
The results are presented against a reference level.
It performs minimal error checking and will crash ungracefully if the wrong things are given to it.
